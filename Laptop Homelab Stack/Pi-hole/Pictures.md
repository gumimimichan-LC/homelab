- The dashboard just holds the overview of everything and it honestly is super straight foward and organized for easy monitoring.
- I tested the blocklist by just pasting a URL in and it just couldn't be reached. Within 5-10 seconds it updated on the website to show it was blocked from my IP.

## Final Notes:

- That's honestly it. There's not much you need to do as the average person for it to work.
- I've noticed without my ad blocker it isn't gonna stop everything but there is many areas on websites that dont load in which is nice.

Now im done.
