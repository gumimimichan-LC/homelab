# Home Lab Overview

This is my personal **Cybersecurity & systems homelab** repository.
Everything I build and set up will be **free and self-hosted**, so it's accessible to others without paywalls or subscriptions.
The focus is on **learning, monitoring, and documenting real-world setups**.

## Current Projects
- [Plex Media Server](./plex-server/README.md)
- [Raspberry Pi building/testing](./raspberry-pi/README.md)
- [Laptop Homelab Stack](./Laptop%20Homelab%20Stack/README.md)
- [Planned]Router DMZ + network isolation
- [Planned] T-Pot honeypot

- **Notes:**
To be honest, I have no clue what I'm doing. I am just writing and saying what I've done in the confines of these 4 walls. 
Also I am adding a bit of personality to stuff because while I want to show it off later, *currently* it's not for a company, it is to document my findings, projects, and other things. It serious but not that serious right now. Some personality will show how I truly felt in the moment rather than stating "This inquistively frustrated me!" no it did not. It made me want to do dispicable acts to the hardware in my room. 
Sometimes tech is a chore, sometimes its not. Same goes for learning.
