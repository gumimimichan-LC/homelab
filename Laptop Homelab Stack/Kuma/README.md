```
### 7. Add monitors

I'm gonna keep this simple, I'm only gonna explain unbound as an example.

Type: TCP port
Frienly Name: (can be whatever but) Unbound
Hostname: 127.0.0.1
Port: 5335
Monitoring Group: Laptop Stack (keeps it simple and organized)
Description: Unbound - DNS Cache Server/Recursive DNS Lookup
Save.

Notes:
- Pretty simple is kinda nice
- Not all programs are easy but if you think outside the box you can make anything work - Ex. pihole was confusing but i just linked the web ui and it worked
