# Intro
  I am not leveraging the help of ChatGPT for the final product. I do write the whole thing myself but I have ChatGPT copy it into the format I prefer that I did (with the help of it) the first time.

  I am overly annoyed with the fact I have to do this so this will be as NOT straight foward as possible since my genuine emotions and thoughts will be broadcasted through this medium.

  ## Purpose
  
  The reason you'd want a parent-child set up is so you can aggregate all the data into one dashboard. I will eventually have a honeypot using TPot on my network but have decided against running data to the dashboard as it could compromise my network. Tis will be covered in the Honeypot when I finally get TWO more ethernets to hook it all up. I also installed the basic version on the other one so you can't add services. Awesome. Let me go fix that right now so people know.

  TLDR: Parent-Child configuration is good for when you have multiple devices running services you want to monitor
